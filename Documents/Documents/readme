AprilTag ROS indigo
ROS contributors have come up with a package of AprilTag based on Michael Kaes library. This package is easy to use but there are certain steps one needs to implement in order to have it working successfully.
Step 1: Installation

#Install Ros indigo ->
#In the terminal type the following

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
# Update the bashrc file in the home folder so you dont need to source it all the time

cd ~
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
#Create a catkin workspace
# Set up catkin_ws

mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
# Update environment for catkin

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

# Install Apriltag_ros library
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-apriltags-ros
# you also need the usb_cam package installed in order to use the apritags_ros package
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-usb-cam


Step 2: Calibrate your camera and get camera calibration parameters
# Follow this link : __http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration__
# you will get camera parameters which is the intrinsic matrix that consists of camera intrinsics
# This file will be of .yaml form. Copy this file to the home/.ros/.camera_info folder. Name the #.yaml as calibration_parameter.yaml
mkdir ~/.ros/.camera_info
cp calibration_parameter.yaml ~/.ros/.camera_info




Step 3: How to use this package
In order to use this package you need to specify tag ids and size in the launch file you create. You cannot rosrun this node and get tag ids.
These are the pre-requisites for using this package.
1. usb_cam package and apriltag_ros package should be installed
2. Create a launch file similar to example.launch in apriltag_ros package (you will find that in the apriltag_ros/launch folder. In the launch file mention the tag ids you want to detect and their size in meter. Also include usb_cam.launch in the launch file.
3. Calibrate your camera and import the yaml file. Copy that yaml file with appropriate camera name in the home/user/.ros/camera_info folder. Make sure this file name matches to the file name in usb_cam.launch file. Below in the example the file name for my camera was head_camera.yaml.
4. roslaunch apriltag_ros [launchfilename].launch
5. Note: Below is an example of a launch file that I created for testing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------Launch file example---------------------------------------------------------------------

<launch>
<arg name="video_device" default="/dev/video0"/>

<arg name="show_tag_detections" default="false"/>

<node pkg="usb_cam" type="usb_cam_node" name="usb_cam" output="screen">

<param name="video_device" value="$(arg video_device)"/>

<param name="camera_name" value="head_camera"/>

<param name="pixel_format" value="yuyv" />

</node>

<node pkg="apriltags_ros" type="apriltag_detector_node" name="apriltag_detector" output="screen">

<remap from="camera_info" to="usb_cam/camera_info"/>

<remap from="image_rect" to="usb_cam/image_raw"/>

<remap from ="tag_detections" to="person_tag"/>

<rosparam param="tag_descriptions">[

{id: 0, size: 0.163513},

{id: 10, size: 0.163513, frame_id: a_frame},

{id: 2, size: 0.163513},

{id: 3, size: 0.163513},

{id: 4, size: 0.163513},

{id: 52, size: 0.163513}]

</rosparam>

</node>

</launch>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------end of file------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Topic type: geometry_msgs/PoseStamped pose
Rostopic echo /tag_detections
To extract the pose in callback function you need to call msg->detection[0].pose.pose to get the entire 4*4 affine matrix.
In case you get the topic but all values of the pose are 0 then your calibration parameters have not been found by the ros master so check for errors while launching and correct the launch file
